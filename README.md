# Dismath-Portfolio
# Week 1
- During our first meeting, we had a short seatwork just to recall the topics about Dismath. I was able to answer number 10 which was about the Euler.
- Sir also introduced to us the Propositions and asked us one by one about it. I was asked if x+9=11 is a proposition and I answered no because we do not know the true value of x which may or may not satisfy the statement.
- On our nexrt meeting, we tacked about gates which was also discussed during our days in Logicir. 
- We answered the exercises (odd numbers) one by one in class. The questions were mainly about translating the equation into a statement with the given phrases.
